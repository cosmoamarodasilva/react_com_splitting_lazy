Thus, when such type is used in an IDE with autocompletion, no suggestions are made for the declared literals.\n\nThis type is a workaround for [Microsoft/TypeScript#29729](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729). It will be removed as soon as it's not needed anymore.\n\n@example\n```\nimport {LiteralUnion} from 'type-fest';\n\n// Before\n\ntype Pet = 'dog' | 'cat' | string;\n\nconst pet: Pet = '';\n// Start typing in your TypeScript-enabled IDE.\n// You **will not** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.\n\n// After\n\ntype Pet2 = LiteralUnion<'dog' | 'cat', string>;\n\nconst pet: Pet2 = '';\n// You **will** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.\n```\n */\nexport type LiteralUnion<\n\tLiteralType extends BaseType,\n\tBaseType extends Primitive\n> = LiteralType | (BaseType & {_?: never});\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
