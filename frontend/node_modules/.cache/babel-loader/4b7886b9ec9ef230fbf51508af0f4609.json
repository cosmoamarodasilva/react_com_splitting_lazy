The `Omit` type does not restrict the omitted keys to be keys present on the given type, while `Except` does. The benefits of a stricter type are avoiding typos and allowing the compiler to pick up on rename refactors automatically.\n\nPlease upvote [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30825) if you want to have the stricter version as a built-in in TypeScript.\n\n@example\n```\nimport {Except} from 'type-fest';\n\ntype Foo = {\n\ta: number;\n\tb: string;\n\tc: boolean;\n};\n\ntype FooWithoutA = Except<Foo, 'a' | 'c'>;\n//=> {b: string};\n```\n*/\nexport type Except<ObjectType, KeysType extends keyof ObjectType> = Pick<ObjectType, Exclude<keyof ObjectType, KeysType>>;\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
